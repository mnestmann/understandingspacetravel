		<h1>About this Website</h1>
		<h2>Organization of Site</h2>
		<p>This website provides an introduction and overview of space exploration. It is divided into 4 major sections.
		The page on History reviews major developments in science, politics, art, and literature which set the stage for
		our current relationship with outer space. The next topic describes several important lessons that we can glean from this 
		historical understanding toward Solving Big Problems that we might encounter. Key Concepts moves us from the past into the present
		by providing some notes and a video on the basic mechanics of rockets. The final section of the site looks toward the future and helps us relate
		to space personally by looking more in-depth at the varieties of careers and needs in space exploration.</p>
		<h2>Deciding Where to Begin</h2>
		<p> While the site is laid out in a roughly chronological order, from past to present to future, you don't have to explore it that way. 
		You will find it more fruitful if you take some time to consider
		what your major questions are regarding space exploration. Then look at the sections which you think will be most likely
		to answer your questions. Here are the questions that drove my initial inquiry into the subject.</p>
		<h3>Question 1:</h3> 
		<p class="indent">How have people taken a large, seemingly impossible question like the possibility of traveling in space
		and broken into smaller pieces that make it possible to solve?</p>
		<h3>Question 2:</h3> 
		<p class="indent">Where is space traveled headed and what are the different roles that people can play in moving us forward?</p>
		<p>As you look through the site, you'll see how these questions are interwoven through the information provided.
		</p>
		<h2>Theory of Learning Used in This Site</h2>
		<p>The sequence of content on this site is based on active learning principles, particularly metacognition. At the beginning of each lesson, readers 
		are prompted to create their own questions or consider questions of significance regarding the lesson. This helps readers to process
		the material actively rather than passively. When readers are learning concrete knowledge, they take pretests and then are encouraged to
		review material to improve their ability. It's never enough to end with factual understanding, however. All lessons provide activities to help
		readers make connections between concepts, apply content, improve their comprehension of the topic, and reflect on what they are learning. 
		Where possible, social learning theory is incorporated into the site, as well, based on the belief that people learn best when the are 
		actively applying knowledge in community.</p>
