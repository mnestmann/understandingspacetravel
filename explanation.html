		<h1>Key Concepts Regarding Space Travel</h1>
		<h2>So Why Can’t we Just Fly an Airplane into Space?</h2>		
		<p class="pink">Take a moment and think about that question. If you aren't sure, take a guess. How do you think airplanes work? How do you think 
		rockets are different?</p>
		<hr style="border: dotted 1px;">
		<p>Jet engines and rocket engines work in a similar manner. They both combine oxygen and fuel to create a chemical reaction 
		that releases gas. As the gas is released, it creates pressure on the engine, and produces thrust. Thrust is the 
		result of Newton’s 3rd Law—for every action there is an equal and opposite reaction. The jet or rocket is propelled in the 
		opposite direction of the escaping gas. The amount of thrust depends on 1) the mass flow through system and 2) the exit velocity 
		of the gas. </p>
		<p>However, in a jet engine, the oxygen comes from the air surrounding the plane, which is sucked into the engine by a fan. 
		An average jet flies around 550 mph and the fastest jet was recorded at a speed of 2,275 mph. To escape the pull of earth’s gravity, 
		a rocket has to fly at least 25,000 mph. Once the rocket gets out of the earth’s atmosphere, it also can’t use air in the vacuum of space. 
		Rockets, therefore, must use a slightly different propulsion system. The oxidizer in a rocket is in liquid form. There are two main ways 
		of storing the liquid fuel and liquid oxidizer in a rocket. In a liquid rocket, the oxidizer and fuel are stored separately 
		and are piped into a combustion chamber where they burn. In a physical rocket, the oxidizer and fuel are mixed and stored together, 
		but are kept at a temperature where they won’t burn. When the rocket is ready to launch, the chamber is heated, causing the fuel to burn.</p>
		<p>As the rocket increases in mass, greater thrust is needed to lift the rocket out of the earth’s atmosphere. If you build a bigger rocket, 
		you’ll need more fuel to create the appropriate thrust, but keep in mind that fuel also has mass. The more fuel you have, 
		the heavier the rocket will be, which will require more fuel. This dynamic poses interesting challenges in the ratio of fuel 
		to other rocket components. Watch this Ted Talk video to learn more about the Rocket Equation.</p>
