		<h1>What the Story of Space Travel Teaches us about Solving Big Problems</h1>
<!--INTRODUCTION-->
		<p>Thousands of generations have looked at the night sky and wondered what lies outside our planet. 
		Visiting another planet seemed impossible for many of them, but the contributions of people over time have made it a more plausible 
		reality to us today. We can use the history of space flight to help us understand methods for solving big problems. 
		What are the big problems you would like to solve? It might be something that has already been "solved," but that you would like to learn.
		For example, maybe you want to learn another language or how to play an instrument. Or it might be a problem that isn't solved yet.
		Go through each of the lessons below for key principles in addressing questions that seem too large to solve. </p>
<!--LOOKING FOR PATTERNS-->
		<button class="accordion fullwidth"><h2>Looking for Patterns</h2></button></div>

				<p>Long before we had any knowledge about space, ancient people noticed patterns in the sky based on regular observation.
				Recognizing that certain constellations of stars appeared at the same time every year, and that the length of days 
				changed throughout the year, some groups of people created monuments for determining the solstices and equinoxes. 
				They used this knowledge to create calendars, plant crops, and navigate long before we really understood 
				what the stars were or what was in space.</p>
				<p>In a similar way, we learn how to get around a new place and conduct ourselves with a new group of friends by 
				looking for patterns in the way the streets are laid out, or in how our friends act. Finding common occurrences helps us
				learn new things. Even when something feels completely different to us, we can begin to understand it by looking for patterns.</p>
			</div>
				<h3>Activity</h3>
				<p>Consider your big problem.Is there a way that you can observe it regularly? For example, if you wanted to learn a new language, 
				you might find some place (television, community, etc) where you can listen to the language spoken naturally. Keep a journal of your observations
				over several occurrences. 
				<ol>
					<li>What patterns do you notice</li>
					<li>Try to make some predictions and then test your predictions to refine your understanding of the patterns you see.</li>
				</ol>

<!--CREATIVITY AND RESEARCH-->

				<h3>Research Isn't a Four Letter Word</h3>
				<p>You might be tempted to believe that pioneers are only forward thinking, that they are always dreaming about 
				what is possible and experimenting with ways to make it happen. In truth, most people who make great discoveries 
				are passionate about the field in which they work. They enjoy reading and studying about the topic, 
				so they are familiar with what other people have already discovered and tried. For example: </p>
				<ul>
					<li>The Wright brothers studied Lilienthal’s book on aerodynamics before attempting to build a better glider. 
					Later, Chanute’s history of flying was key in helping them develop the airplane</li> 
					<li>Leonardo da Vinci was fascinated with flight and based on his studies, 
					made over 100 drawings for possible flying machines. He was not successful, 
					but the modern helicopter is based on his Ornithopter flying machine.</li>
					<li>Writers and artists do research, as well. The works of successful science fiction writers are believable 
					because they incorporate elements of truth. Edwin Godwin was inspired by the discoveries of Kepler, Copernicus, 
					and Gilbert when he wrote <em>The Man in the Moone</em> and Edgar Allen Poe’s <em>The Unparalleled Adventure of One Hans Pfaall</em> 
					included well-researched details on high altitude balloon flight.</li>
				</ul>
				<p>If you are interested in a topic, you should start looking for information about it.</p>
				<h3>Take Note of the Who</h3>
				<p>A big mistake that people make when conducting research is to only focus on the “what”. Accomplished scholars 
				understand that they should also focus on the “who”. Knowing WHO is influential in a field will save you time by 
				helping you to evaluate what you find. Don’t just take Joe Smith on the internet at his word. Does what he says 
				line up with what key experts say? If you know WHO is a major player in the field that interests you, you can look 
				for articles and books written by that person. If she is still alive, you might be able to follow her on social media 
				to keep up with breaking news.</p>
				<p>Knowing WHO can also you help you discover patterns in what you’re reading. People tend to have preferences in who 
				they follow. If two experts disagree, then the scholars that follow them have to choose which position they support. 
				Over time, this process leads to “schools of thought.” As you learn more and more about a topic, you will develop the 
				ability to quickly understand a writer or speaker’s position by knowing who they cite because you will understand 
				what school of thought they are coming from. </p>
				<p>Finally, if you know WHO the major players are, you might be able to find ways to make connections with them. 
				As appropriate, reach out to experts with questions you have. Attend presentations given by people you follow. 
				Maybe even apply to work with that person. Scholars will be more likely to listen to your ideas if they have some 
				kind of connection with you and know who you are.</p>
				<p>It’s vitally important to remember that becoming an expert yourself starts with listening. You cannot begin 
				to contribute to the field until you know what other people have already learned and what people are currently talking about.</p>
				<p>Review this Timeline of Space Exploration to learn about key contributors from the past. Major players 
				working on space travel today include NASA, SpaceX, Virgin Galactic, ADD HERE</p>
				<h3>Leave Room for Creativity</h3>
				<p>At the same time, don’t become so focused on what other people are saying that you never think outside of the box. 
				The best science fiction writers took their understanding of scientific discovery and the political climate to imagine 
				what might be possible in the future. In turn, these authors inspired the astronauts, scientists and entrepreneurs 
				of today (LINK TO TIMELINE). Allow yourself to creatively imagine other possibilities. O
				n the Understanding Key Concepts (LINK) page, you’ll find a Ted Talk that asks us to consider new types of rockets 
				in order to overcome the “tyranny of the rocket equation.” In whatever field you find yourself, it can be helpful 
				sometimes to “back up” from what we currently know and question the assumptions upon which that knowledge is based. 
				Are there any other possibilities? Give yourself license to brainstorm new ideas, no matter how crazy they may sound. 
				Then analyze your ideas to see if they have any potential or lead you anywhere. You should balance creativity with 
				research to become a successful pioneer.<p>
			</div>
				<h3>Activity</h3>
				<p>Pick a topic of interest. Look for information in the library and online. Rather than recording facts, 
				start by making a list of the people who are influential in that field (both past and present). 
				Who does everybody seem to be citing (or talking about)? These are the people you should learn more about. 
				Next, look for books, articles, and videos by those people. Start by reading/viewing what they have to say. 
				If the person is still alive, do they have a social media account where they share about their work? Follow it. </p>
			</div>
<!--IMPORTANCE OF COMMUNITY-->
			<button class="accordion fullwidth"><h2>The Importance of Community</h2></button>
			<div class="panel">
				<p>Great ideas aren’t developed in isolation. We’ve already learned how important the “Who” is to research. 
				The Who matters in the present as well as the past. Pioneers like Elon Musk and Richard Branson are not 
				doing all the work themselves. They are building teams around them. Find people who are already doing work 
				in the field that interests you and see if you can join them. If you are new to the field, you may have to 
				start with more local and less well-known resources before connecting with major players. Is there a class 
				on the topic at your local college? Is there an interest group that meets in person or online regarding 
				that topic? As you grow in your understanding and ability, think about applying to work in your field. 
				Attend conferences on the topic and introduce yourself to people.</p>
